# RSTGNN
Robust Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network
The directory of Models are a few recurrent graph neural network that could be used for dynamic node classification and link prediction
The directory of Start are core code for runing the dynamic node classification and link prediction according to different neural networks
In the Start, train.py and train2.py could test different types of neural networks
Directories of dataset and dataloader are raw dynamic graph data and associated dataloader.
